### Technical Details
- Networking is implemented with gRPC and simple Protobuf definitions.
  - gRPC can be up to 7x faster than REST for large payloads, according to this [benchmark](https://medium.com/@EmperorRXF/evaluating-performance-of-rest-vs-grpc-1b8bdf0b22da)
- Requires an existing port mapping from the network gateway to a local port. This is pretty inconvenient.
  - Possible workarounds:
    - use [jUPnP](https://github.com/jupnp/jupnp) library to programmatically add port mapping with UPnP
    - use [portmapper](https://github.com/offbynull/portmapper) library to programmaticallyadd port mapping with NAT-PMP
